# # We learnt mainly 4 types of python data types.
# # 1)Lists 2)Sets 3)Tuples 4)Dictionaries
# # Lists-Lists are a type of data structure containing an ordered collection of items. They are
#   mutable,that we can search, add and delete the information.Example; [1,2,"3",4]
#   2)Sets-Set is collection of new elements without order which are used when an object only needs to exist within a collection of objects and its order or number of appearances are not important.
#   Example;{"1","2","3","4"}
#   3)Tuples-We can say that the tuples are doing same functionality as a lists but main difference between the two is that  list is immutable, meaning it cannot be modified or deleted but tuples mutable.
#   Example; (1,2,"3",4)
#   4)Dictionaries- mutable data structure that contain a collection of keys and values.We use dictionaries when we are able to associate in technical terms, to map a unique key to certain data, and we want to access that data very quickly.
#   Example; {"1key":"2value","1key":"2value"}

    # We can say that they are True or False or logical operators that we can evaluate the information True or False.
    # The AND operator returns True only if both information are True , the OR operator returns True if either information is true.

      # # Git-Git is used to tracking changes in  code and manage some changes.It is very useful when programmers are working from different locations.
      # For example, git push origin master , when run on a remote,  we will push  changes to the master branch of the primary repository database.
      # #   Git clone -is a command for downloading existing source code from  repository. Git init- is used to create an empty Git repository.Git Commit - we had  development, we want to save our changes to others.
      #     Git Add- moves changes from the working directory to the direct area.

      # #   The method _init_ - it is a method that we can create new instance of a class.It permits us to initialize the attributes of the object.
      #      We can say also constructor.
           Example
# class information_about_hayvon():
#     def __init__( self,ism, yosh,):
#         self.ism = ism
#         self.yosh = yosh

          #  Inheritance permits us to clarify a new class that has access to the methods and attributes of another class that has already been clarified.
